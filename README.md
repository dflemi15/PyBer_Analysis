Pyber Ride-sharing Analysis

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a comparative look into Pyber ride-sharing data by city. This analysis then breaks down the data and provides a visual analysis of how the cities perform on a week-by-week basis. This will provide useful context into the data for more informed decision making. Recommendations are then provided who how the company can address the disparities between the cities.   

Results

The analysis of the Pyber ride-sharing data begins on January 14, 2019 and ends on April 25, 2019, approximately a four month period. The first step of the analysis was to gather general information on how each city type compared to each other based on a few selected categories. This analysis yielded the following results:

Urban cities led all three major categories of “Total Rides”, “Total Drivers”, and “Total Fares”. Urban cities also charged the least average fare per ride and driver compared to the other areas. This may be a contributing factor as to why the total rides in urban cities more than double to total rides in suburban cities and is approximately thirteen times the amount in rural communities. The total amount of drivers is also significantly skewed in favor of urban communities due to the higher volume of riders.

The line chart provides further visualization of the disparity between city types in regard to total fare. Urban areas appear to be performing much better than their rural and suburban counterparts on a weekly basis. 

Summary

Considering the information provided by the analysis, I have a few recommendations that may improve performance in the rural and suburban areas. The chart listed above appears to illustrate a correlation between average fare price and number of rides. For instance, the urban cities have a significantly lower average fare price than in the other two city types. In order to increase the ride-share revenue in the rural and suburban cities, Pyber leadership should consider lowering fare prices in these areas to attract more riders. In addition, there appears to be an abundance of drivers in the suburban cities. In contrast, rural and suburban cities appear do not appear to have enough drivers to meet demand as indicated by the “Total Driver” number being less than “Total Rides” in each of those locations. Increasing hiring efforts in those locations to increase the number of drivers may also increase revenue.  Finally, average fare per driver is significantly higher in the suburban and rural cities than in the urban cities. Both of these locations show a higher average driver fare than the actual average fare. Introducing a cap for the driver fare may lower cost for the riders and increase engagement.
